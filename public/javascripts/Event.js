We are experiencing a delay when it comes to processing BTC LTC and BTCD withdrawal transactions. Our technical team is working hard to get the withdrawals moving as fast as they can.

Why would they know more than the collective hive-mind of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem? \n\nIt simply made no sense. \n\nThen the most obvious thing struck me: Satoshi wanted you, me, and everyone involved in Bitcoin, mining on our PC\u0027s. And it is *us* who are supposed to be casting the votes on what the Dev team is supposed to do. The power is supposed to be in the hands of the ecosystem. The very group of people who the Dev team has said should have \"no say\". \n\n*Its no surprise that at the Bitcoin scaling conference this week, the 10 people running the mining pools explicitly stated they don\u0027t want to make the decision, because they\u0027re not qualified to.*\n\nSatoshi did not envision decisions in bitcoin being made by core developers. And consensus was supposed to come from a large volume of individuals from across the ecosystem. Decisions were supposed to be made by us.
